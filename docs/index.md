# Project Proposal

## Problem statement

The goal of our project is to compare different segmentation methods that we have learned about in class with current state-of-the-art techniques. We will also explore how different feature spaces affect clustering and graph based approaches to segmentation.

## Approach

The techniques we will be comparing include:

1. Clustering-based approaches:

   - K-means clustering
   - Mean shift clustering

2. Graph-based approaches:

   - Min-cut
   - Normalized cut

3. TODO
